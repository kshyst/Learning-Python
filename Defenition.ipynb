    "<p>Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes the code written in Python language. It is a command line program that takes the code as input and executes it. It is also known as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It reads the code line by line and executes it immediately. If there is an error in the code, it stops the execution and shows an error message.</p>\n",
